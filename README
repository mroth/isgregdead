# Is Greg Dead?

Greg works weird hours.  Sometimes we don't see him.  We worry like a Jewish mother!  This app helps us not worry.

## Configuration

Since this needs to scan private github repositories, you'll need to enter your github credentials in the config file - *AND* work at bitly..  sorry!

To run locally
    GITHUB_USERNAME=foo GITHUB_PASSWORD=bar rails server

To set it for Heroku do it via config:add
```
$ heroku config:add GITHUB_USERNAME=foo GITHUB_PASSWORD=bar
Adding config vars:
  GITHUB_USERNAME => foo
  GITHUB_PASSWORD => bar
Restarting app... done.
```
